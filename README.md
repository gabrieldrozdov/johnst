# John St.

This was a quick one-off website visualizing multiple perspectives of my street.

You can access the site by going to [gabrieldrozdov.github.io/john-st](https://gabrieldrozdov.github.io/john-st/). Scroll up and down to view the whole street block.

## Who made this?
The site was designed and developed fully by Gabriel Drozdov (me!). This project was created during RISDâ€™s Graduate Studio II Spring 2023 course with the supervision of Lucinda Hitchcock and Paul Soulellis.
